* About
This library is to support [[https://github.com/Bad-ptr/persp-mode.el][persp-mode]] in the new version of [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm-buffers]].

In ~persp-mode~, if to support ~helm~, it is required to set the variable ~persp-set-ido-hooks~,
however it doesn't work anymore in the new version of ~helm~.  in
[[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/2311]] (2020/5/30), ~helm~ was changed to "*get rid of ido
for listing buffers*", so that "persp-set-ido-hooks" won't take any effect on helm.

In the implementation of this library, it adds advice to the helm function ~helm-buffer-list~, and
use the functions provided by ~persp-mode~ to filter the buffer list of current frame. This
implementation doesn't have any performance issue.

* Installation

    :load-path "packages/helm-persp-buffer-list"
